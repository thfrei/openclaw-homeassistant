- **Full Agent Access**: Your Clawdbot can check emails, manage calendar, access files, browse web, and use all configured integrations
- **Natural Conversations**: Multi-turn conversations with persistent memory and context
- **Secure Communication**: All requests sent securely to your Clawdbot Gateway's agent endpoint

### Example Interactions

Your Clawdbot can handle a wide variety of requests through Home Assistant voice interface:

**Email & Communication:**
- "Do I have any important emails from [person]?"
- "Send an email to [person] about tomorrow's meeting"
- "What messages are in my inbox?"
- "Who sent me a telegram message?"

**Calendar & Scheduling:**
- "What's on my calendar today?"
- "When is my next meeting?"
- "Add a dentist appointment for next Tuesday at 2pm"
- "Check me in for my flight tomorrow"

**Information & Web:**
- "Search for restaurants near me"
- "What's the weather forecast for this week?"
- "Look up the latest news about [topic]"
- "Browse to [website] and summarize the main article"

**Files & Documents:**
- "Find my notes about [topic]"
- "What's in my [filename] file?"
- "Save this to my notes: [content]"

**Conversational & Knowledge:**
- "Who are you?"
- "Explain how photosynthesis works"
- "What's 2 plus 2?"
- "Tell me a joke"

**Custom Skills:**
- Any custom skills or integrations you've configured in Clawdbot

**Note**: The exact capabilities depend on your Clawdbot configuration, installed skills, and service integrations. For basic home automation commands like "turn on the lights", you may want to use Home Assistant's built-in intents alongside Clawdbot for the best experience.

## Remote Gateway Setup

If your Clawdbot Gateway is running on a different machine, you have two options:

### Option 1: Direct Connection (Recommended with SSL)

Configure the integration with your Gateway's hostname/IP and enable SSL:
- Host: `gateway.example.com` or IP address
- Port: `18789`
- Use SSL: ✓ (enabled)
- Gateway Token: Required

### Option 2: SSH Tunnel

Set up an SSH tunnel separately and connect via localhost:

```bash
# Set up SSH tunnel (run this command on your Home Assistant machine)
ssh -N -L 18789:localhost:18789 user@gateway-host
```

Then configure the integration:
- Host: `127.0.0.1`
- Port: `18789`
- Gateway Token: (Optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors

**Cannot reach Clawd Gateway:**
- Check that the Gateway is running: `clawdbot status`
- Verify the host and port are correct
- Check firewall rules
- For remote connections, ensure SSL is enabled if required

**Authentication failed:**
- Verify your token is correct
- Check Gateway token configuration: `echo $CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN`
- For localhost connections without a token, leave the token field empty

**Response timeout:**
- Agent execution is taking longer than the configured timeout (default: 30 seconds)
- Typical response time is 5-10 seconds for most queries
- Complex questions may take longer (up to 30+ seconds)
- Increase the timeout setting in integration options if needed
- Check Gateway logs for issues

### Performance Issues

**Slow responses:**
- Most queries respond in 5-10 seconds
- Complex reasoning or long responses may take 15-30+ seconds
- This is normal for AI agent processing
- Consider increasing the timeout for complex queries

**Connection drops:**
- Check network stability
- The integration will automatically reconnect
- Check Gateway logs for any issues

## Limitations

- **Response time**: Typical queries take 5-10 seconds. Agent tasks (emails, web browsing, file access) may take longer depending on complexity. This is slower than traditional rule-based voice assistants (1-2 seconds) but provides significantly more capability
- **Streaming**: Responses are buffered and returned complete (no streaming TTS support during generation)
- **Home Automation**: Best used alongside Home Assistant's native intents for device control. Your Clawdbot excels at information, complex tasks, email/calendar management, and agentic workflows rather than simple "turn on the lights" commands
- **Context**: Conversation history within Home Assistant is managed by ChatLog. Your Clawdbot's persistent memory across all platforms remains intact
- **Capabilities**: What your voice assistant can do depends entirely on your Clawdbot configuration, installed skills, and service integrations

## Security

- **Token storage**: Tokens are encrypted at rest by Home Assistant
- **SSL/TLS**: Recommended for all remote connections
- **SSH tunnels**: Can be used as an alternative to direct connections
- **Non-SSL warning**: The integration warns when connecting to non-localhost without SSL

## Advanced Configuration

### Updating Settings

You can update the Gateway connection settings without removing the integration:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find the **Clawd Voice Assistant** integration
3. Click **Configure**
4. Update settings as needed
5. Click **Submit**

### Session Keys

The **Session Key** setting allows you to route Home Assistant conversations to specific Clawdbot sessions:

- **Default (`main`)**: The standard direct-chat session - conversations appear in your main Clawdbot session
- **Custom sessions**: Use a different session key to organize Home Assistant conversations separately
- **Use cases**:
  - Keep Home Assistant conversations isolated from other Clawdbot interactions
  - Route to different agents if you have multiple configured
  - Organize conversations by purpose (e.g., `home-assistant`, `automation`, etc.)

To use a custom session, simply enter the desired session key in the integration configuration.

### Voice-Optimized Session Configuration

For the best voice assistant experience, you can configure a dedicated Clawdbot session with a system prompt optimized for spoken responses. This keeps responses brief and TTS-friendly.

**Step 1: Create a voice-optimized session in Clawdbot**

In your Clawdbot configuration, create a new session with a system prompt like:

```
You are a voice assistant for a smart home. Keep your responses:
- Brief and conversational (1-3 sentences when possible)
- Natural for text-to-speech (avoid bullet points, formatting, code blocks)
- Free of emojis and special characters
- Direct and to the point

When performing tasks (emails, calendar, etc.), confirm the action briefly rather than explaining in detail.
```

Refer to the [Clawdbot documentation](https://docs.clawd.bot/) for details on configuring custom sessions and system prompts.

**Step 2: Use the session in Home Assistant**

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Clawd** → **Configure**
2. Set the **Session Key** to your voice-optimized session name (e.g., `voice-assistant`)
3. Click **Submit**

Now all voice commands through Home Assistant will use your voice-optimized configuration, while other Clawdbot interfaces (Telegram, Discord, etc.) continue using their own settings.

### Emoji Stripping

The **Strip emojis from TTS speech** option controls whether emojis are removed from spoken responses:

- **Enabled (default)**: Emojis are removed from text-to-speech output for cleaner speech
  - Example: "I'm Claude 🦞" → Speaks "I'm Claude"
  - Emojis remain visible in the conversation history
- **Disabled**: TTS attempts to read emojis (may sound awkward depending on your TTS engine)
  - Example: "I'm Claude 🦞" → Speaks "I'm Claude lobster emoji"

**When to disable:**
- You have a high-quality TTS engine that handles emojis well
- You prefer emoji descriptions to be spoken
- You're using the integration primarily through text (Assist interface) rather than voice

You can change this setting anytime in **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Clawd** → **Configure**.

### Multiple Gateways

You can add multiple Gateway connections if needed:
- Each Gateway requires a unique host:port combination
- Configure multiple conversation entities
- Select different agents in different voice assistant configurations
