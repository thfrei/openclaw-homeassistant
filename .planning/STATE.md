# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-25)

**Core value:** Users can reliably talk to their Clawdbot agent through Home Assistant voice interfaces without connection failures or cryptic errors interrupting the experience.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Simple Unit Tests (in progress)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 7 (Simple Unit Tests)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase - COMPLETE
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-25 - Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (Emoji Stripping Tests)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] ~25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.27 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | 10 min | 3 min |
| 02 | 2 | 6 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (1 min), 01-03 (8 min), 02-01 (3 min), 02-02 (3 min)
- Trend: Consistent ~3 min average

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Tests first, then features - Safety net before behavior changes
- pytest + pytest-asyncio - Standard HA testing stack
- Mock WebSocket for unit tests - Avoid real network in tests
- asyncio_mode = "auto" for automatic async test handling (01-01)
- Function-scoped fixtures via asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope (01-01)
- pytest-homeassistant-custom-component >=0.13.200 for Python 3.11+ (01-01)
- Factory pattern for mock_config_entry (01-02)
- Patch target is gateway module, not websockets directly (01-02)
- Async generator pattern for mock connect (01-02)
- Dual-mode fixtures work with or without HA framework (01-03)
- HAS_HA_FRAMEWORK flag controls fixture behavior (01-03)
- Skip markers for HA-specific tests when framework unavailable (01-03)
- Direct module loading via importlib.util to bypass HA framework dependency (02-01)
- Class-based test organization mirrors source file structure (02-01)
- pytest.mark.parametrize with ids for readable exception test output (02-01)
- try/except import with local fallback for standalone mode testing (02-02)
- Test actual behavior, document known limitations in docstrings (02-02)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 (Test Infrastructure):**
- ~~Need to verify pytest-asyncio and pytest-homeassistant-custom-component versions compatible with Python 3.11+~~ RESOLVED: Using >=0.13.200
- ~~Must establish cleanup pattern early to prevent "Event loop is closed" errors in all subsequent tests~~ RESOLVED: async_cleanup fixture created (01-02)
- Windows Long Path issues prevent full HA framework installation - tests run in standalone mode (14/15 pass)

**Phase 2 (Simple Unit Tests):**
- Direct module loading pattern required to bypass __init__.py imports - RESOLVED with importlib.util (02-01)

**Phase 5 (Protocol Layer):**
- WebSocket mocking patterns require careful design to match real library behavior (reconnection, mid-operation failures)

**Phase 7 (Robustness):**
- Retry logic changes behavior - must ensure tests catch regressions
