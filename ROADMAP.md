# Roadmap & Enhancement Plan

This document outlines planned features, optimizations, and improvements for the Clawd Home Assistant integration based on Clawdbot Gateway capabilities.

## 🔥 High Priority Features

### 1. Streaming Responses
**Status:** Implemented  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Impact:** High

Streaming responses are supported when the Home Assistant conversation API exposes a streaming result. The integration streams cumulative agent output from the Gateway and falls back to buffered responses on older HA versions.

**Current Behavior:**
- Uses streaming conversation results when available
- Streams output chunks as the Gateway publishes agent events
- Falls back to buffered responses if HA doesn't support streaming

### 2. Sub-Agent Task Spawning
**Status:** Implemented  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Impact:** High

Leverage `sessions_spawn` for background task execution.

**Use Cases:**
- "Research restaurants and email me the results"
- "Check flight status every hour and notify me of changes"
- "Monitor my inbox for messages from [person] and alert me"
- Complex multi-step tasks that shouldn't block voice response

**Implementation:**
- `clawd.spawn_task` service
- Accept task description, optional cleanup policy, label, timeout
- Polls task status and fires `clawd_task_complete` event on completion
- Automations can react to the event to notify or act

**Example Service Call:**
```yaml
service: clawd.spawn_task
data:
  task: "Research Edinburgh restaurants with good reviews and email me a list"
  cleanup: "delete"
  notify_on_complete: true
```

### 3. Model Selection & Reasoning Mode
**Status:** Partial  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium

Expose gateway's model selection and thinking capabilities.

**Current:**
- Per-request model override
- Thinking/reasoning mode control (off/low/medium/high)

**Planned:**
- Auto-detect complex queries and enable reasoning
- Cost-aware model selection

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# Integration options
model_strategy: "auto"  # auto, fast, balanced, powerful
thinking_mode: "auto"   # off, low, medium, high, auto
```

**Auto-Detection:**
- Simple queries → sonnet (fast)
- "Explain", "analyze", "compare" → opus + high thinking
- Cost tracking per model

### 4. Session Management
**Status:** Backburner  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium

Dynamic session switching and multi-session support.

**Current:**
- Configurable session key
- `clawd.set_session` service to switch the active session

**Backburner:**
- Multiple conversation entities for different sessions
- Session history access (`sessions_history`)
- Cross-session message sending (`sessions_send`)

**Use Cases:**
- Separate work vs. personal assistant sessions
- Family members with individual sessions
- Context isolation (home automation vs. general queries)

## 🚀 Medium Priority Features

### 4. Memory Integration
**Status:** Planned  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium

Leverage Clawdbot's `memory_search` for context-aware responses.

**Benefits:**
- Pull relevant past conversations
- Personalized responses based on preferences
- Cross-platform context ("What did I ask you on Telegram?")

**Implementation:**
- Pre-query memory search for relevant context
- Inject context into conversation prompt
- Expose as optional feature (privacy considerations)

### 5. Cron & Reminder Integration
**Status:** Planned  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Impact:** High

Integrate with gateway's cron system for scheduled tasks.

**Features:**
- Voice-activated reminders
- Recurring task scheduling
- Integration with HA automations
- "Remind me to check the oven in 20 minutes"

**Implementation:**
- `clawd.schedule_reminder` service
- Parse natural language time expressions
- Fire HA events on reminder trigger
- Support one-time and recurring reminders

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Connection Pooling & Keepalive
**Status:** Implemented  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium

Persistent WebSocket connection with ping/pong keepalive and automatic reconnects.

**Benefits:**
- Lower latency on first request
- Reduced connection overhead
- Immediate failure detection
- More reliable in poor network conditions

### 2. Response Caching
**Status:** Planned  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Impact:** Low-Medium

Cache identical queries for short duration.

**Strategy:**
- Cache responses for 30-60 seconds
- Hash query + context for cache key
- Bypass cache for explicit "new" queries
- Size limit to prevent memory issues

**Use Cases:**
- Repeated "What's the weather?" → instant response
- Same question from multiple family members
- Accidental duplicate voice triggers

### 3. Parallel Query Processing
**Status:** Planned  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium

Support compound queries with parallel execution.

**Examples:**
- "What's the weather AND check my calendar"
- "Email summary AND upcoming meetings"

**Implementation:**
- Parse compound queries (AND, ALSO, THEN)
- Fire independent queries in parallel
- Aggregate responses
- Gateway already supports concurrency

### 4. Adaptive Timeout Handling
**Status:** Planned  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium

Auto-adjust timeout based on query complexity.

**Strategy:**
- Quick queries: 10s timeout
- Tool-using queries: 30s timeout
- Research/complex: 60s+ timeout
- Learn from historical response times

**Detection:**
- Keyword-based (simple heuristics)
- Response time history per query type
- Explicit timeout override in advanced cases

## 📊 Observability & Diagnostics

### 1. Usage & Cost Tracking
**Status:** Partial  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Impact:** Medium

Expose `session_status` metrics as HA sensors.

**Current:**
- `sensor.clawd_tokens_used`
- `sensor.clawd_estimated_cost`
- `sensor.clawd_message_count`

**Planned:**
- `sensor.clawd_queries_today`
- `sensor.clawd_avg_response_time`

**Benefits:**
- Monitor AI usage
- Cost awareness (paid models)
- Performance tracking
- Usage patterns

### 2. Enhanced Diagnostics
**Status:** Partial  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Impact:** Low

Expand diagnostic data for troubleshooting.

**Current:**
- Connection status
- Redacted config/options
- Gateway health (when reachable)

**Additional Data:**
- WebSocket connection stats
- Query latency breakdown
- Error frequency/types
- Memory usage
- Active sessions list
